    >Entities evolving freely over time</h2
    ><p
    >In Affinity, each instance of an entity (aka <em
      ><a href="./terminology.html#pin"
	>PIN</a
	></em
      > or <em
      >object</em
      > or <em
      >instance</em
      >) is free to contain any attribute at any time. An entity is not bound to any table (or <em
      >type</em
      > or <em
      ><a href="./terminology.html#class"
	>class</a
	></em
      > or <em
      >category</em
      >). Instances evolve independently from the categories to which they may belong at any point in time. This is accomplished without any compromise with respect to transactional integrity or performance: PINs and their classification change in the context of transactions, and rely on indexes. A transaction can involve any number of PINs.</p
    ></div
  ><div id="discoverability-information-re-use-and-information-sharing"
  ><h2
    >Discoverability, information re-use, and information sharing</h2
    ><p
    >While objects can evolve freely in Affinity, it remains possible to discover and track them at any moment. Affinity provides several mechanisms: <a href="./terminology.html#class"
      >classification</a
      >, full-scan queries (not recommended for deployed applications but convenient during development), and <a href="./terminology.html#notification"
      >notifications</a
      >.</p
    ><p
    >The ability to query the store is essential for mutli-user collaboration and for inter-application interoperability. Objects created or modified by one agent can be discovered by other agents without explicit transmission of data between agents. The agents simply monitor (or wait for notifications from) the database, which serves as a common intermediary, similar to &quot;publish and subscribe&quot; messaging systems.</p
    ><p
    >Information re-use is the idea that the information in a persisted object should not be locked up by the application which created the object. If the information is valuable to its owner, the owner should be able to manipulate that information using a variety of applications (of the owners choice).</p
    ><p
    >Information sharing is the idea that if information is represented with sufficient &quot;semantics&quot;, then it can be shared and interpreted by other systems. Note that even a partial shared understanding of some of the properties in an object between systems is sufficient for this kind of interoperability.</p
    ></div
  ><div id="self-descriptiveness"
  ><h2
    >Self-descriptiveness</h2
    ><p
    >Objects in Affinity are naturally serializable as dictionaries that fully describe their full contents. Therefore, it's trivial to export or transport objects.</p
    ></div
  ><div id="data-before-structure-a-two-step-modeling-process"
  ><h2
    >Data before structure (a two-step modeling process)</h2
    ><p
    >Affinity makes it possible for data to exist before structures (or schema) are defined, refined or modified. This capability rests in part on the definition (by applications) of a globally meaningful, consistent and stable vocabulary of <a href="./terminology.html#property"
      >property names</a
      >. The selection (or creation) of such a vocabulary represents the first step of data modeling with Affinity, and suffices to enable the creation of data. The second step is categorization, and it happens independently and dynamically. Affinity recognizes that pre-defined structures and schema are essential for most computer programs. This separation between pure (intrinsic) data structure and application-enabling schema is designed to facilitate the coexistence of applications, and their sharing of data. Affinity also allows to transform data at query time.</p
    ></div
  ><div id="property-names-as-uris:-avoiding-confusion"
  ><h2
    >Property names as URIs: avoiding confusion</h2
    ><p
    >By requiring a global vocabulary of <a href="./terminology.html#property"
      >property names</a
      >, and emphasizing the importance of selecting universal, high-quality definitions from the start (that will last throughout the life-cycle and at every level of the modeling process), Affinity reduces the chances of confusion related to imprecise terminology.</p
    ></div
  ><div id="agile-categorization"
  ><h2
    >Agile categorization</h2
    ><p
    >The relational approach implies a water-fall modeling process: an a-priori, all-or-nothing exercise of categorization (one cannot insert rows in a table that is not yet defined). This often crystallizes into rigid physical models (tables, views, indexes), where objects can only be represented in one state of their potentially evolving structure (for example, in real life a merchandise item may be moved or modified; depending on where the merchandise is located, more or less attributes may be required to track it; it's not possible in a relational database to just move that row across various tables). Also, it is difficult to 'correct' pitfalls once the database contains data. Incomplete or extensible models (such as plug-in architectures) require awkward modeling strategies. Integration with external data sources can be painful. In contrast, Affinity proposes a much more agile approach, where <a href="./terminology.html#class"
      >categories</a
      > can be created and modified iteratively, without affecting the data. Categories and structures can be known to (or defined by) some software components (e.g. plug-ins), and ignored by others.</p
    ></div
  ><div id="super-types-as-first-class-citizens"
  ><h2
    >Super-types as first-class citizens</h2
    ><p
    >With Affinity, the identity of objects is automatically secured (by their <a href="./terminology.html#pin-id-pid"
      >PID</a
      >), and the type hierarchy is free to evolve independently from instances. Super-types can pre-exist sub-types, and when sub-types are declared they don't modify, invalidate or hide super-types, or force any manual reorganization of the data. Types can be specialized and combined. Objects can match multiple types (aka <a href="./terminology.html#class"
      >classes</a
      > or categories). Use-cases that imply a proliferation of sub-types are not a problem for Affinity. Software components are free to interact with super-types or sub-types, at their convenience.</p
    ></div
  ><div id="no-need-to-model-attributes-as-entities"
  ><h2
    >No need to model attributes as entities</h2
    ><p
    >In the relational model, when it becomes too difficult to model complex problems due to unstable or unpredictable structures, a last-resort solution involves a method sometimes referred to as &quot;very high level of attribute generalization&quot;, which consists in modeling attributes as entities, such that arbitrary sets of attributes can be combined to represent a wider variety of things. Affinity's <a href="./terminology.html#pin"
      >PIN</a
      > does that implicitly.</p
    ></div
  ><div id="no-need-to-create-unnecessary-structures"
  ><h2
    >No need to create unnecessary structures</h2
    ><p
    >Not all structures require the same level of detail in modeling, or the same accessibility. For example, applications that handle catalogs of components will be primarily interested in organizing common aspects of these components, and would gladly leave out the minute details of each component (plug-ins can take care of these details; or generic introspective methods can walk the complementary information). The exercise of fitting all this component-specific data into a relational model becomes a waste of time, justified mainly by the need for a unified storage infrastructure. Affinity allows these structures to coexist (without the pain of rigid modeling), and to evolve into their ideal usage in due time (with the help of dynamic classification).</p
    ></div
  ><div id="temporary-data-in-place-and-implicitly-indexed"
  ><h2
    >Temporary data in-place, and implicitly indexed</h2
    ><p
    >Another consequence of Affinity's data model is that temporary data can be attached directly to already existing <a href="./terminology.html#pin"
      >PINs</a
      >. All pre-existing indexes on those PINs remain valid access paths to the temporary data, and come at no extra cost. The same holds for references. Compared with temporary tables, this can represent a significant performance advantage (in terms of indexing and locking, for example). Affinity does not require any special (in-advance) modeling or planning.</p
    ></div
  ><div id="exclusivity-arcs-in-place"
  ><h2
    >Exclusivity-arcs in-place</h2
    ><p
    >In relational modeling, exclusivity-arcs model mutually exclusive relationships between entities (e.g. an inventory item can only be at one place at one time). In the object-oriented realm, this can be represented with a pointer to a base-class, and sub-classes. With Affinity, another option is to implement this in-place, with a single <a href="./terminology.html#pin"
      >PIN</a
      > that just evolves over time.</p
    ></div
  ><div id="automatic-assignment-of-globally-unique-ids-to-all-instances"
  ><h2
    >Automatic assignment of globally-unique IDs to all instances</h2
    ><p
    >The relational model implies a complex decision process for each table: the selection of a primary key. Object databases in general, and Affinity in particular simplify this process by attributing a globally unique surrogate key (<a href="./terminology.html#pin-id-pid"
      >PID</a
      >) to every object (<a href="./terminology.html#pin"
      >PIN</a
      >). This key enables random access to the instance, without the cost of an additional index lookup. Combined with <a href="./terminology.html#pin-reference"
      >references</a
      >, it simplifies the modeling of relationships, and the traversal of graphs. In the context of super-types and sub-types, the globally unique PID eliminates issues such as contention for the next (shared) unique id across multiple tables, or partially-null primary keys. In the context of data warehousing, the PID removes the problem of accounting for each new dimension table in the compound primary key of the fact table. More generally, these characteristics reduce significantly the justification for debates around primary (and surrogate) keys encountered with relational systems.</p
    ></div
  ><div id="references-and-easy-graph-navigation"
  ><h2
    >References and easy graph navigation</h2
    ><p
    >By avoiding joins for traversals on specific instances, Affinity provides similar advantages as object and graph databases, in comparison with relational systems. Affinity also allows set operations on references, and <a href="./terminology.html#collection"
      >collections</a
      > of <a href="./terminology.html#pin-reference"
      >references</a
      >, providing the best of both worlds <em
      >(note: path indexing is not yet available, but planned for a future release; when relevant, joins are used in the meantime)</em
      >. References are simpler to model than foreign keys, and further reduce the burden in terms of selecting keys upfront (and in an immutable way).</p

    >No compromise with transactions</h2

    >Affinity makes no compromise with transactions. For example, it integrates full-text indexing and searching into the transaction boundaries, with the same ACID guaranties as everything else. The default PIN locking protocol used is &quot;strong 2-phase-locking&quot; (all locks that a top-level transaction has acquired are held until the transaction terminates). Unlike document databases, which usually can't do multi-object transactions, Affinity takes no shortcut with respect to transactions. This choice makes room for the coexistence of applications that require full transactional support, along with applications that require weaker transactional guaranties (such as those well suited for document databases).</p

Considerable efforts were invested to make Affinity's recovery rock-solid.</p

However, Affinity avoids intimate associations with any particular object-oriented programming language, by providing a pure-data abstraction (the <a href="./terminology.html#pin"
      >PIN</a
      >) and low-level expression evaluation primitives. Also, Affinity does not attempt to solve the memory management complications implicit in traditional object-oriented systems. In that respect, Affinity adopts a stance similar to some of the recent graph and document databases.</p

    >Constraints transformed into qualifying criteria for classification</h2
    ><p
    >In general, constraints are conspicuously absent from Affinity's interfaces. This is because Affinity is designed to bridge together various data storage approaches and representations of knowledge, with special care to allow evolution of structures in time. In relational modeling, even simple attributes can actually model constraints (e.g. only a woman can have a maiden name). With Affinity, constraints become qualifying criteria for classification (if a class requires a maiden name, then only objects with a maiden name will be classified by it; or conversely, if a class excludes maiden names, then objects with a maiden name will not be classified by it). However, pathSQL also provides a way to emulate traditional constraints, with its syntax to insert objects into a set of existing classes (in which case, if a new object doesn't comply with any of the specified classes, it won't be inserted).</p

    >Affinity offers AES encryption of pages and log files.

Sessions are authenticated for owner and guest users. Affinity's interface also prevents SQL injection attacks.</p

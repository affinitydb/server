    >PIN</a
    >, <a href="#property"
    >property</a
    >, <a href="#value"

  ><div id="pin"
  ><h3
    >PIN</h3
    ><p
    >The PIN is Affinity's primary information node. It's the basic unit of data. It is somewhat analogous to the row of a relational table, the object of an object-oriented database, the node of a graph database or of XML's DOM, the document of a document database etc. A PIN can contain many <a href="#property"
      >properties</a
      >. Each property of a PIN can either hold a single (scalar) <a href="#value"
      >value</a
      >, or an arbitrarily large <a href="#collection"
      >collection</a
      > of values. Unlike rdbms rows, PINs aren't constrained to any table, and can actually belong to many <a href="#class"
      >classes</a
      >. Each PIN can describe its own unique structure (i.e. enumerate its <a href="#property"
      >properties</a
      >). PINs can <a href="#pin-reference"
      >refer</a
      > to each other. Properties can be added to PINs (or removed) without limitation. Each PIN is uniquely identified by a <a href="#pin-id-pid"
      >PIN ID</a
      >.</p
    ><p
    ><em
      >Note: the theoretical maximum number of properties per PIN is related with the configured <a href="#page"
	>page</a
	> size - typically, in the order of thousands of properties on a PIN; this limit only puts a boundary on the structural complexity of a PIN, not the amount of data that each property can contain</em
      ></p
    ></div
  ><div id="property"
  ><h3
    >Property</h3
    ><p
    >Properties are symbolic entities (names) that define the relationship between a <a href="#pin"
      >PIN</a
      > and its <a href="#value"
      >values</a
      >. Properties define the structure of a PIN. A property, in Affinity, is somewhat analogous to the column name of a relational table, or to a predicate in <a href="#rdf"
      >RDF</a
      >. Property names can be composed of multiple sections, separated by a slash (/) character, following the same convention as URIs. This enables a practically infinite, semantically coherent <a href="#namespace"
      >namespace</a
      > usable across multiple applications (which may not necessarily be fully aware of each other). The basic data model of Affinity does not attach any type information to properties: instances of a property (<a href="#value"
      >values</a
      >) can be of any type. Properties are a key component of <a href="#class"
      >class</a
      > definitions, because they establish a semantic relationship across PINs (two PINs that contain the same property have something in common, and can be classified accordingly). Because there is no constraint on any value's type, Affinity may perform data type <a href="#coercion"
      >coercion</a
      > when required. Internally, a numeric ID is associated with each property. This ID is only valid in the scope of one database instance; any reference to a property outside of that scope must use the textual representation of the property.</p
    ><p
    >In the data modeling process with Affinity, selecting meaninful, stable property names constitutes an important first step, that can influence the effectiveness of categorization into <a href="#class"
      >classes</a
      > later on. When possible, it is recommended to refer to an already existing source (ontology). The semantic web community uses resources such as the following, to achieve similar goals:</p

  ><div id="value"
  ><h3
    >Value</h3
    ><p
    >Like in any database, values can be numbers, strings, booleans, dates, times, <a href="#blob"
      >BLOBs</a
      > etc. A value can also be a <a href="#pin-reference"
      >reference</a
      > to another <a href="#pin"
      >PIN</a
      > (or to another <a href="#property"
      >property</a
      > of a PIN, or even to a specific collection <a href="#element-id-eid"
      >element</a
      >). There's also a data type attribute allowing to attach a physical <a href="#unit-of-measurement"
      >unit of measurement</a
      > to a value. In a future release, it will also be possible to define customized sub-structures (as values embedded in a PIN). Data types are described in detail <a href="./pathSQL%20reference.html#data-types"
      >here</a
      >. At the programming level, the same value structure is also used to hold a <a href="#collection"
      >collection</a
      >. In Affinity, every instance of a value is free to be of any type; Affinity may perform data type <a href="#coercion"
      >coercion</a
      >.</p
    ></div
  ><div id="collection"
  ><h3
    >Collection</h3
    ><p
    >A collection is an ordered list of scalar <a href="#value"
      >values</a
      >, held by a <a href="#pin"
      >PIN</a
      > via a <a href="#property"
      >property</a
      >. The values of a collection can be heterogeneous (they can have different types). Internally, each element of a collection is uniquely identified by an immutable <a href="#element-id-eid"
      >Element ID (eid)</a
      >. This design enables consistent interactions in concurrent access scenarios. Note that collections cannot directly contain nested collections, in the current version. Small collections can be represented as arrays internally, and allow random access, whereas very large collections must be traversed with an iterator (with the option of seeking to any known <a href="#element-id-eid"
      >eid</a
      >). A collection can hold up to 32-bit worth of distinct addressable elements. Collections can be queried just like plain values (additional control is provided). Collections also play a key role in other aspects of the data model, such as <a href="#acl"
      >ACLs</a
      >.</p
    ></div
  ><div id="class"
  ><h3
    >Class</h3
    ><p
    >The class is Affinity's main mechanism of data organization. It is very similar to the materialized view of some relational databases, in the sense that classification operates automatically (<a href="#pin"
      >PINs</a
      > are not explicitly declared to belong to a class) and synchronously (in the context of transactions). Where a table or a view would be used in the relational model, one could use a class in Affinity to achieve a similar organization. A class is a stored query predicate (involving any number of <a href="#property"
      >properties</a
      >). It is most often defining an <a href="#index"
      >index</a
      >, although this is not mandatory. Classes can be declared at any point in time (both earlier and later than the occurrence of PINs satisfying the predicate). Classes are named according to similar conventions as properties (using URIs). Unlike the 'classes' of programming languages such as C++ or java, Affinity classes don't define static <em
      >types</em
      >, in the sense that they don't establish a binding contract with <a href="#pin"
      >PINs</a
      >: a PIN can belong to a class during a part of its lifetime, and stop belonging to it during another period; as long as the PIN satisfies the predicate, it's part of the class. A PIN can belong to several classes at once. Classification triggers <a href="#notification"
      >notifications</a
      >. Affinity defines a generalization of classes called <a href="#family"
      >families</a
      >, but the term 'class' is often used to represent both concepts. 'Category' may also be used as a synonym for 'class' (to avoid the static type connotation).</p

  ><h3
    >PIN ID (PID)</h3
    ><p
    >The <a href="#pin"
      >PIN</a
      > ID is a globally unique ID, <em
      >determined by Affinity</em
      > when a new PIN is first committed to the database. It's composed of two main sections: an <a href="#identity"
      >identity</a
      > ID, and a 64-bit value, unique in the scope of that identity. Within the scope of one instance of an Affinity database, PINs created by the owner can be designated with the second (64-bit) section only, since the first section will be 0 (STORE_OWNER) - this elision is common, for example in pathSQL's <a href="./pathSQL%20reference.html#refid"
      >references</a
      >. By convention, the text representation of this second section should always be in hex. PIDs are immutable, and are usually not recycled (if a PIN is deleted, there is no risk that dangling references would ever point to a new, unrelated PIN) - unless explicitly requested (e.g. to store streaming or temporary data). PIDs can be used to specify fixed sets of PINs in a query, or to hold on to a PIN, or to create <a href="#pin-reference"
      >references</a
      >.</p

  ><h3
    >Element ID (eid)</h3
    ><p
    >In a <a href="#collection"
      >collection</a
      >, every value is associated with a unique, immutable Element ID (a 32-bit unsigned value, <em
      >determined by Affinity</em
      >). This eid is independent from the position of the element in the collection. A few special logical eids are defined in the Affinity <a href="#interfaces"
      >interfaces</a
      >, to let the client define an initial ordering for new collection elements: STORE_COLLECTION_ID, STORE_FIRST_ELEMENT, STORE_LAST_ELEMENT. As soon as the new elements are inserted in the database, Affinity gives them a new immutable eid.</p

  ><h3
    >Family</h3
    ><p
    >A family (short for &quot;family of <a href="#class"
      >classes</a
      >&quot;) is a generalization of the concept of class. It is sometimes referred to as a &quot;parametrized class&quot;. It can also be viewed as a sorted index, by analogy with the relational model. Whereas a simple class only indexes <a href="#pin-id-pid"
      >references to the PINs</a
      > that satisfy its predicate, a family also indexes the values of those PINs that correspond with free <a href="#parameter"
      >parameters</a
      > in the predicate. For example, one could define an &quot;adult&quot; <em
      >class</em
      > (with the predicate &quot;age &gt;= 18&quot;), or an &quot;age_limit&quot; <em
      >family</em
      > (with the predicate &quot;age &gt;= :0&quot;).</p
    ></div
  ><div id="parameter"
  ><h3
    >Parameter</h3
    >In the context of a class <a href="#family"
    >family</a
    >, a parameter is an unspecified (free) value in the definition of the predicate. It usually implies an <a href="#index"
    >index</a
    >. Typically, this <a href="#value"
    >value</a
    > is provided at query time. For example, using pathSQL, one could define:<pre>'CREATE CLASS age_limit AS select * where age >= :0;'</pre>and then query with<pre>'SELECT * FROM age_limit(18);'</pre>
</div
  ><div id="uncommitted-pin"
  ><h3
    >Uncommitted PIN</h3
    ><p
    >This concept is more or less invisible, depending on the interface used to talk to Affinity. An uncommitted <a href="#pin"
      >PIN</a
      > is a representation that is not yet stored in the database. The C++ interface allows to create uncommitted PINs in memory, that can be inter-connected (and form any number of graphs). These PINs can be committed very efficiently in a single-operation transaction (thus minimizing the amount of disk io required, and maximizing opportunities for data compaction on <a href="#page"
      >pages</a
      >). The implementations supporting the <a href="#protocol-buffer"
      >protocol-buffer</a
      > streaming interface and <a href="#pathsql"
      >pathSQL</a

    >PIN Reference</h3
    ><p
    >A reference is a special <a href="#value"
      >value</a
      > type that allows to create explicit relationships between <a href="#pin"
      >PINs</a
      >. It maps naturally to the concept of reference or pointer, in most programming languages. From a database perspective, it enables a form of navigation that can reduce significantly the number of joins required by an application. A <a href="#property"
      >property</a
      > can contain a <a href="#collection"
      >collection</a
      > of references. All types of references contain at least a <a href="#pin-id-pid"
      >PID</a
      >, but can also contain a <a href="#property"
      >property</a
      > ID, and even a specific <a href="#element-id-eid"

      >values</a

Each user is identified by name, and the store associates a numeric ID to each name (the numeric ID of the database owner is 0 (STORE_OWNER)). Within the context of any specific database instance, a fully qualified <a href="#pin-id-pid"
      >PID</a

    >The page is the logical unit most closely related with the physical layout of data on disk. Every page represents a contiguous segment of the database file. When an instance of a Affinity database is created, an immutable page size must be specified (the default is 32768 bytes). Every element of information (<a href="#pin"
      >PINs</a
      >, <a href="#index"
      >indexes</a
      > etc.) is stored on one or more pages. Because disk io is typically very time consuming, and databases typically require more disk storage than memory can hold, an important task of database systems is to minimize io (by compacting as much data as possible on a page, by mapping pages in and out of memory as efficiently and infrequently as possible, by keeping related data on pages that are near, by organizing indexes to satisfy common queries with as few pages as possible, etc.). Although Affinity takes care of most of the complexity, the application developer must be at least minimally aware of these considerations (e.g. to optimize queries, and use features like <a href="#ssv"

By comparison with triggers and stored procedures, Affinity's notifications establish a more strict boundary between the kernel and application code. They enhance application code consistency and maintainability, by concentrating all the logic in one place, using one language. They can also constitute the starting point of a messaging system between database instances.</p

    >Affinity uses the Read-Only multiversion [ROMV] protocol for read-only transactions, thus enabling non-blocking reads. This only applies to transactions that are explicitly specified as read-only by the caller. These transactions read a snapshot that will correspond to the effect of committed write transactions up to the point the read-only transaction started (n.b. if the number of snapshots grows very large at any point in time, an older [already allocated] snapshot may be used). In contrast, plain read-write or read-only transactions (not explicitly marked as read-only by the caller) progress according to the 2-phase-locking protocol, and may in some cases read data items in a &quot;newer&quot; state than the corresponding explicit read-only transaction would.</p

It exposes a set of C++ abstract base classes (aka C++ interfaces), plus a few constants and structures. The ISession interface represents a logical connection to a database instance, and provides an entry point for every possible interaction. It exposes the <a href="#pathSQL"
      >pathSQL</a
      > dialect, as well as the <a href="#protocol-buffer"
      >protocol-buffer</a
      > streaming interface. At a lower level, query conditions and <a href="#class"
      >class</a
      > predicates can be defined using expression trees (IExprTree), which enable the embedding application to develop any desired query language (e.g. sql, xquery, sparql, linq etc.), and compile it into this low-level representation. <a href="#pin"
      >PINs</a
      > are mainly represented by the IPIN interface, which allows fine-grained control of the in-memory snapshot of a PIN and related read-write activity to the database (in the context of one specific session). Since affinity.h is primarily a kernel integration interface (rather than a client interface), most of the design decisions related with memory and reference management were taken by ranking performance implications with higher importance than ease of use.

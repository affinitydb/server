  >Release Notes</h1
  ><p
  >AffinityNG is a major evolution of its ancestor (AffinityDB), having the graph database grow into a universal embedded information-processing, control and communication platform. In the process, in addition to all the new functionality added, some syntactic and semantic changes were made. Most of these changes would be invisible from an ordinary application (for example, the whole online tutorial of AffinityDB is still valid in AffinityNG, unchanged). We'll enumerate those changes briefly here.</p
  ><div id="changes"
  ><h2
    >Changes</h2
    ><ul
    ><li
      >The default store file name in AffinityNG is <code
	>affinity.store</code
	> (as opposed to <code
	>affinity.db</code
	>). Note that AffinityNG is not binary-compatible with AffinityDB, and thus won't read <code
	>affinity.db</code
	> files. We are considering to provide an upgrade path from AffinityDB to AffinityNG. Should you be in that situation, please let us know, either via an issue in github or a message in our discussion forum.</li
      ><li
      >In the <code
	>StoreCreationParameters</code
	> structure (C++), the <code
	>fEncrypted</code
	> field became a bit of a new <code
	>mode</code
	> field, alongside new bits such as <code
	>STORE_CREATE_PAGE_INTEGRITY</code
	>.<!-- TODO: enable when it's there (e.g. beta, or maybe before)
 * The functionality of the `server` process evolved into a service of the kernel, and the process itself moved to
   the `daemons` project. The REST interface exposed by AffinityDB's server has not changed and remains fully supported
   in AffinityNG.  
--></li
      ><li
      ><code
	>createServerInputStream</code
	> and <code
	>IConnection</code
	>: These elements of the single-threaded server interface were removed (asynchronous request handling migrated to the new communication stack).</li
      ><li
      >Several minor and major security improvements were made, including an upgrade to AES256, SHA256 etc.</li
      ><li
      >The URI prefix for built-in properties and other primitives in AffinityNG is <code
	>http://affinityng.org/builtin/</code
	> (as opposed to <code
	>http://affinitydb.org/builtin/</code
	> in AffinityDB).</li
      ><li
      >The SPARQL-style comment (<code
	># comment</code
	>) is no longer supported in pathSQL.</li
      ><li
      ><code
	>PREFIX</code
	>, <code
	>SET BASE</code
	> and <code
	>SET PREFIX</code
	>: The per-statement <code
	>PREFIX</code
	> was removed, and <code
	>SET PREFIX</code
	> and <code
	>SET BASE</code
	> now operate like a compiler directive (analogous to #define in C) rather than a statement, and can be prepended to any statement or group of statements (separated with a semicolon). Their scope is one interaction with AffinityNG (i.e. one REST request, one <code
	>q</code
	> call from a client library, or one <code
	>IStmt::execute</code
	> or <code
	>ISession::execute</code
	> call in C++). These changes participate in an effort to reduce per-session state to an absolute minimum.</li
      ><li
      ><code
	>SELECT @ FROM ...</code
	>: This form no longer selects a PIN's ID, but rather has the same effect as <code
	>SELECT * FROM ...</code
	>; to select the PIN's ID, one must now do <code
	>SELECT afy:pinID FROM ...</code
	>.</li
      ><li
      ><code
	>afy:ClassOfClasses</code
	>: This special class was renamed to <code
	>afy:Classes</code
	>.</li
      ><li
      ><code
	>afy:classID</code
	>: This special property (aka <code
	>PROP_SPEC_CLASSID</code
	>) was replaced by the more general <code
	>afy:objectID</code
	> (<code
	>PROP_SPEC_OBJID</code
	>).</li
      ><li
      ><code
	>afy:URI</code
	>: This special property (aka <code
	>PROP_SPEC_URI</code
	>) was replaced by the more general <code

	>.</li
      ><li
      ><code
	>UPDATE ... FROM x</code
	>: This form is no longer supported; it was replaced with <code
	>UPDATE x ...</code
	>.</li
      ><li
      >Full text indexing is no longer enabled by default; to reflect this, the <code
	>META_PROP_NOFTINDEX</code
	> flag was replaced by its opposite, <code
	>META_PROP_FTINDEX</code
	>.<!-- TODO: augment this when it also becomes true of class indexing... --></li
      ><li
      ><code
	>PIN_NO_INDEX</code
	> no longer exists; PINs to be hidden from normal queries can be marked as <code
	>PIN_HIDDEN</code
	>, but they may still be indexed.</li
      ><li
      ><code
	>OP_REGEX</code
	> no longer exists and was replaced by <code
	>OP_SIMILAR</code
	>, which now fully implements regular expressions, with conditions of this form: <code
	>SELECT WHERE myproperty SIMILAR TO /.*something$/</code
	>.<!-- TODO: activate when fully implemented
 * Notifications have been formalized in such way that they are now sent only upon fully committed (i.e. topmost)
   transactions, as opposed to leaking information during ongoing transactions. For the same reason,
   the C++ method `IStoreNotification::txNotify` was removed.
--></li
      ><li
      >In the C++ interface, <code
	>openStore</code
	> and <code
	>createStore</code
	> no longer return an opaque context pointer, but rather a pointer to a new interface named <code
	>IAffinity</code
	>. The <code
	>shutdownStore</code
	> function became <code
	>IAffinity::shutdown</code
	>, and a few new global methods were introduced for new functionality (e.g. service registration).</li
      ><li
      >In the C++ interface, <code
	>createPIN</code
	> and <code
	>createUncommittedPIN</code
	> changed names, for <code
	>createPINAndCommit</code
	> and <code
	>createPIN</code
	> (this is to reflect AffinityNG's preference for in-memory processing by default). The notion of batch insert has been distinguished from the broader topic of in-memory PINs, and a new interface was introduced for batch insert specifically: <code
	>IBatch</code
	>.</li
      ><li
      >The PIN's update stamp is now represented by an optional built-in property (<code
	>afy:stamp</code
	> aka PROP_SPEC_STAMP), and is no longer accessible via the C++ <code
	>IPIN::getStamp</code
	>. The <code
	>afy:stamp</code
	> property must be added explicitly at PIN creation, in the same manner as <code
	>afy:updated</code
	>, <code
	>afy:created</code
	> etc.</li
      ><li
      >In the C++ interface, <code
	>Value::setPart</code
	> is no longer available. A PIN can still be referenced as a &quot;part&quot; by setting the <code
	>META_PROP_PART</code
	> flag on that referencing property. Alternatively, <code
	>VT_STRUCT</code
	> (expressed in pathSQL with <code
	>INSERT mystruct={field1='Value1', field2='Value2', ...}</code
	>) can be used to hold structured parts even closer to the owning PIN.</li
      ><li
      >A number of smaller changes were made in the C++ interface, such as <code
	>STORE_INVALID_PROPID</code
	> being renamed to <code
	>STORE_INVALID_URIID</code
	>, <code
	>ClassSpec</code
	> to <code
	>SourceSpec</code
	>, <code
	>ISession::alloc</code
	> to <code
	>ISession::malloc</code
	>, the <code
	>AfyDB</code
	> namespace renamed to <code
	>Afy</code
	>, etc.</li
      ><li
      >The output of <code
	>SELECT HISTOGRAM(property) FROM ...</code
	> changed slightly, and now contains an <code
	>afy:aggregate</code
	> property.</li
      ><li
      >The old <code
	>ACL_READ</code
	> and <code
	>ACL_WRITE</code
	> have become standard <code
	>META_PROP_READ</code
	> and <code
	>META_PROP_WRITE</code
	>.</li
      ><li
      ><code
	>ISession::setURIAlias</code
	> has been removed.</li
      ><li
      >Most state held by a an <code
	>ISession</code
	> was migrated to a different scope; the session is practically stateless now, except for its transaction stack.</li
      ><li
      ><code
	>CLASS_CLUSTERED</code
	> and <code
	>CLASS_UNIQUE</code
	> are no longer available.</li
      ><li
      >A few other rarely or never used <code
	>META_PROP_*</code
	> and <code
	>PIN_*</code
	> flags were removed.</li
      ><li
      >The usage of referencing (&amp;) and dereferencing (*) operators in pathSQL was simplified.<!-- TODO: review in detail the changes in path expressions, if the sum of them justifies it
